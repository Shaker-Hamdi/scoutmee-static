                                        <p>Photos: Under Edit Profile, click on Photos and choose whether you want to add a profile photo or a photo to your gallery. Click “Choose Files,” find the photo on your computer and double-click on it. Then just click “Upload.” Don’t forget to check the box saying you own the rights to the photo and add a description to it and all the tags you feel applicable (that will help us increase our search functions).</p>
                                        <p>Bonus tip: You can upload multiple photos at a time! Just hold Ctrl as you select the files you want.</p>
                                        <p>Audio: Under Edit Profile, click on Audio and then "Link Audio" (recommended) or “Upload Audio.” You can import songs from your SoundCloud profile to always keep track of them and ensure hi-fi quality. Otherwise, fill in the Song Title and Original Artist (this is the person who wrote or originally performed the song). Click “Choose File,” find the audio file on your computer and double-click on it. Then just click “Upload.” (Please make sure that you specify the rights to the song)</p>
                                        <p>Videos: Under Edit Profile, click on Videos and then "Link Videos" (recommended) or “Upload Video”. To import your videos from YouTube or Vimeo, just copy and paste the video’s link/URL into the Video Link URL box and click “Add Video.” Super easy and only takes a second. Otherwise, you can click “Choose File,” find the video file on your computer and double-click on it. Then just click “Upload.” (Please make sure that you specify the rights to the video). </p>

                                        <p>You may dispute reviews only if they are obscene, abusive, or fraudulent. If a review you receive meets one of the above, then it can be disputed. When you select to dispute a review, it will be held for arbitration while we review your information and possibly contact the reviewer for fact-checking. If facts check out, you will be given an opportunity to work out your differences with the reviewer and if mutually agreed, the review can be removed.</p>
